                    Until the early 1980s, Kerala was a relatively unknown destination, with most tourism circuits concentrated around the north of the country.
                    Aggressive marketing campaigns launched by the Kerala Tourism Development Corporation—the government agency that oversees tourism prospects of the state—laid the foundation for the growth of the tourism industry.
                    In the decades that followed, Kerala Tourism was able to transform itself into one of the niche holiday destinations in India.
                    The tag line Kerala – God's Own Country was adopted in its tourism promotions and became a global superbrand.
                    Kerala is regarded as one of the destinations with the highest brand recall.
                    In 2010, Kerala attracted 660,000 foreign tourist arrivals.

                    The state's tourism agenda promotes ecologically sustained tourism, which focuses on the local culture, wilderness adventures, volunteering and personal growth of the local population.
                    Efforts are taken to minimize the adverse effects of traditional tourism on the natural environment and enhance the cultural integrity of local people.
                    The state has also made deep inroads into MICE Tourism mainly centered at Kochi.To promote tourism in Kerala, the Grand Kerala Shopping Festival was started by the Government of Kerala in 2007.
